This lab focuses on css styling to make a horizontal and vertical navigation bar. In this lab, I learned the principle of ordering CSS styles downwards in ascending specificity and to work with multiple elements and pseudo elements. 


For example, the positioning and padding elements help create nice spacing and centering of the navigation boxes (of which there are three present in each navigation bar). Using IDs, I styled <nav> and its children to remove the bullet points and to allow scaling with window size.
